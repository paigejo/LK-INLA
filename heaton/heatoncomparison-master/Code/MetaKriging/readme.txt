Thanks Matt for putting together all these things.
Here are the Files:

(1) matt_satellite_data_newest.R  :  Real data analysis file

(2) matt_simulation_newest.R :  simulation study file

(3) Meta_Kriging_Simulation_30_subsets.txt: 

    Records posterior predictive median, 2.5% quantile and 97.5% quantile 
    for the meta posterior in the simulated data. This computation is done 
    with 30 data subsets.

(4) Meta_Kriging_Simulation_35_subsets.txt: 

    Records posterior predictive median, 2.5% quantile and 97.5% quantile 
    for the meta posterior in the simulated data. This computation is done 
    with 35 data subsets.

(5) Meta_Kriging_RealData_30_subsets.txt: 
    
    Records posterior predictive median, 2.5% quantile and 97.5% quantile 
    for the meta posterior in the real data. This computation is done 
    with 30 data subsets.

NB: I have also attached the simulated and the real data herewith
